### ABSTRACT
Numerical analysis of TE and TM modes in metallic circular waveguides using GNU Octave for simulations is provided. Doing so, the approach focuses on understanding mode characteristics, cutoff frequencies, and field distributions. Bessel functions form part of mathematical formulation for this purpose, and custom algorithms are formed to identify zeros of these functions in a bid to calculate propagation constants. Visualizations of electric and magnetic field distributions provide an insight into the behavior of electromagnetic waves and also underscore the role that TE and TM modes play in optimizing waveguide performance for different applications.

### INTRODUCTION
Metallic circular waveguides are crucially important in high frequency communications, covering both radar and satellite communications. For proper waveguide design, knowledge of TE and TM modes is essential because they describe electric and magnetic field behavior. The book explores mode propagation, cutoff frequencies, and spatial field distributions governed by the wave equation with solutions containing Bessel functions.

### SOFTWARE DESCRIPTION
GNU Octave was adopted for this work due to the solid numerical computation facilities, which are the following:
1. **Bessel Function Computation**: Used for calculating radial field dependencies along the waveguide.
2. **Root Finding**: A specific algorithm searches for the roots of Bessel functions, which defines the cutoff frequencies
3. **Field Distribution Visualization**: Plots of electric and magnetic fields are offered with the plotting functions in Octave.
4. **Implementation of Specific Algorithm**: A streamlined procedure incorporates numerical methods and visualizations.
END
The Octave code consists of an explanation of how the analysis of the Bessel function is implemented, calculations of cutoff frequencies for TE and TM modes, as well as the visualization of field distributions. The key components of the code are:
A function which is used to find zeros of Bessel functions
Calculation of cutoff frequencies.
Visualization of field distributions for both TE and TM modes.

### RESULT ANALYSIS
1. **Cut-off Frequencies**:Inferred from the zeros of Bessel functions. TE modes were found to have increasing cut-off frequencies with each order of mode, and TM modes have a slight higher cut-off frequency frequency due to the boundary conditions.
2. **Propagation Constants**: Determined following the computation of cut-off frequencies. High-cut-off frequency implies a better wave propagation.
3. **Field Distributions**:visualization plots showed that TE modes have electric fields radially directed while the magnetic field is circularly symmetric, TM modes possess significant axial electric components.
4. Mode Dependence on Radius of the Waveguide: The increased radius of the waveguide decreases the cutoff frequencies and amplifies more modes .
5. TE vs TM Mode Comparison: The cutoff frequency for the TE is much lower in comparison to the TM mode, but the latter is linked with a complex structure for field.
6. Numerical Stability and Accuracy: The numerical solutions were stable and accurate as this was done for all values of parameters.
7. Practical Significance: This research has facilitated the optimization of the dimensions of the waveguide while choosing the modes considering the enhancement of the performance of the communication system.

APPLICATIONS
The study has vast applications, such as:
1. **Microwave and Millimeter-Wave Communication**: It is essential for satellite communications and radar systems.
2. **Antenna Feed Systems**: This application leads to improved beam shaping and the low-loss signal.
3. **Medical Imaging and Therapy**: Microwaves are utilized in microwave imaging and treatment for cancer diseases in microwave therapeutic systems.
4. **Millimeter-Wave and THz Technology**: It is of vital importance in 5G networks; also in scientific inquiry.
5. **High Power Microwave Applications**: Very important in particle accelerators and fusion research.
6. **Optical Fiber Communications**: High-performance hollow-core photonic fibers.
7. **Instrumentation and Measurement Systems**: Used in spectroscopy or measurement devices.
8. **Filter and Coupler Design**: Important to pass the filtering signals from any communication system.
END
It is with the high-frequency communication system that the advent of high-frequency systems has necessitated the study of TE and TM modes in metallic circular waveguides, thus setting a basis for improved designs and applications in other fields of interest. Numerical analysis combined with visualization through GNU Octave can further one's understanding and optimize performance in waveguides.
