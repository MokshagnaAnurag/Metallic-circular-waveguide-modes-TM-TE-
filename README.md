# Metallic-circular-waveguide-modes-TM-TE-
This is a numerical analysis of TE and TM modes in a metallic circular waveguide using GNU Octave. Mathematical formulations, custom algorithms for finding cutoff frequencies, and illustrations of electric and magnetic field distributions have been used to explain the significance of these modes in high-frequency communication systems.
